# TSW-APIDemo
A very simple C# Windows Form program which allows you to interact with the TSW API.

# Usage
Start by getting your API Key from "Documents\My Games\TrainSimWorld6\Saved\Config\CommAPIKey.txt" and pasting it into the API Key box.
After that, simply select your method and the requested EndPoint. I suggest starting with a List to see all the available options
